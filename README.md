# react-redux-hapi-fullstack-starter

Starter Kit for Data driven production ready react application

### Why I am building this?

Push to build this starter is simple: best practices and a amazing development experience.
I believe React, Webpack, Redux etc are great frameworks and libraries but its really hard (time taking) to integrate them for a fullstack application.
I have tried my best to keep everything simple so that you can see the code and learn how to integrate by yourself.

It can also help you to quickly run some examples around React/Redux, MaterialUI & Hapi without worrying about integrating it.

I am getting lot of inspiration from [electrode](http://www.electrode.io/site/web.html) and existing boiler plates like [reactGo](https://github.com/reactGo/reactGo)

### Full-stack React
- Hapi
- Babel
- Webpack

### Jest for testing
- Snapshot testing
- Mock data

### Isomorphic React
- ReactDOMServer


Server side entry point is at server.jsx
Client side entry point is at client.jsx



### How to run local dev environment
Once code is downloaded (git clone).
Go to the folder and run npm install.
Open 4 terminals for following commands

1. ```npm run webpack```
2. ```npm run start``` once server started run ```npm run logs```
3. ```npm run test```
4. Use this terminal to run any new npm install or git commit/push.
